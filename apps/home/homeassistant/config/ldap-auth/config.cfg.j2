#     homeassistant:
#       auth_providers:
#       - type: command_line
#         command: /path/to/ldap-auth.sh
#         args: ["/path/to/this/config.cfg"]
#         # Uncomment and see below if you want the Home Assistant
#         # user to be populated with his full name.
#         #meta: true
#
# The settings for this configuration can be taken 1:1 from ldap-auth.sh.
# Just copy them over and adapt to your needs.
