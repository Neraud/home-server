- alias: welcome_notification
  trigger:
    platform: homeassistant
    event: start
  action:
    service: persistent_notification.create
    data:
      title: "Welcome to HomeAssistant !"
      message: |
        This notification is configured by ansible to confirm that the whole provisioning worked fine.
        You now have an out of the box install of HomeAssistant with a couple of settings updated : 
        
        * `secrets.yaml` contains the configuration for mysql
        * `configuration.yaml` uses the MySQL secret to setup the recorder (instead of using a slow SQLite storage)
        * `automations.yaml` triggers this notification.

        It you simply dismiss the notification, it will come back next time HomeAssistant is restarted.
        Please edit `automations.yaml` to permanently remove it.
